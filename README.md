Welcome to the Omega Exchange!  This is a market simulator.

### How To Use

Click Start to begin.

Your current money and total loss/profit are tracked near the top of the screen.

Click on an item to buy it, and click the Sell button beneath any item to sell it.

All items start at $5 and are randomly adjusted each step (along with once immediately on start).  The objective is to buy items and then sell them later for profit, once the price has risen.
